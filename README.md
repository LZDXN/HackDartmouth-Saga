## Elevator Pitch
Writing stories with increasing efficiency without limiting creativity. This AI-powered project lowers the threshold for completing outlines, story settings, and refining their overall style and tone.

## Inspiration
Many people may have ideas of stories they would like to write. However, planning and writing a long story require time and quite a amount of work, which is intimidating especially for beginner writers. World creation, character settings, and storylines can be overwhelming and time-consuming to create, often hindering writers from completing their stories.

The Saga project is here to solve this problem: instead of starting from nowhere or letting AI completely generate the stories, Saga aim to lower the threshold and shorten the time wasted when writers trying to figure out the whole story structure. Saga seeks to address this problem by utilizing AI to assist writers in creating detailed and structured outlines for their stories, allowing them to focus on writing the actual content of their books.

Having a vague idea? Put keywords or words in sentences, and let AI supporting you to brainstorm ideas.
Having trouble with complex characters relationship? Let Saga help you to organize those characters.
Speeding up the writing process? Use auto name completion.


Saga is the assistant you need to help you to create your own stories.

## What it does
Compared to letting AI write stories directly, Saga focuses more on the structural building. While users input their ideas in the window, AI helps the user to store and update character settings and help the user to build an outline for it. Users can edit the outline including the storylines, world lines, every single character's stories, etc.
### Brainstorming
- By keywords
- By core idea

### Character settings
- Basic information (name, nick name, age, etc.)
- Appearance
- Beliefs/Stances
- Social status
- Personality (Based on MBTI)
- Relationships with other characters

### Writing Process
- Outlining
- Auto name-completion
- Modify name after finishing the story (find & replace throughout the whole story)
- Text generation (AI-enpowered)
- Statistics (word count, reading time, counts of characters' apearance etc.)
- Quick search by clicking on the character's name

### After finishing the story
- Proofreading
  - Summarize the body text (AI-enpowered)
  - Compare the summary with the outline
- Publish

## How we built it
React, Node.js, MongoDB, Typescript, and GPT-3.5

## What we learned



## What's next for Saga
### More approaches of outlining [Reference: writers.com](https://writers.com/how-to-write-a-story-outline)
- Plot-based
- Scene-based
- Theme-based

### Character attributes
Beyond what we have already for the character attributes, we will allow users to create/edit/delete customized attributes for each character.

### Children friendly
We will add a children-friendly mode for Saga, which will allow users to create stories for children. The children-friendly mode will have a simplified interface and will only allow users to create stories for children.
Also, in the brainstorming session, we will ask AI to generate a sentence starter, let children using their creativity to finish the rest of the stories.

### Connect to graphic AI
We will connect Saga to graphic AI, which will allow users to create characters and scenes with graphic AI.
- Users can also use graphic AI to create the cover of their books.
- Use graphic AI to create the characters avators
- Manga
- Cartoon
- Game
- Connect to Metaverse

### Publish & Share
We will allow users to publish their stories on Saga or other potential platforms, which will allow other users to read their stories. Users can also share their stories on other social media platforms.
In addition, this can potentially collaborate with other platforms and sponsors to pay for the writers.

### Multi-language (multilingo) support
We will support multiple languages, which will allow users to create stories in different languages.
