<!-- ## Elevator Pitch
Writing stories with increasing efficiency without limiting creativity. This AI-powered project lowers the threshold for completing outlines, story settings, and refining their overall style and tone. -->
Unleash your creativity with AI-powered efficiency.
## Problem Statement
Stories are intriguing, but many interesting stories nipped in the bud. Although writers practice their writing skills, outlining and consisting stories still intimidating. World creation, character settings, and storylines can be overwhelming and time-consuming, often hindering writers from completing their stories. 

## Inspiration
This project idea was contributed by Jing Gao, who is currently writing a long fantasy novel. Fantasy novels typically feature new world settings, but despite trying various writing and organizing tools, she still found herself feeling inconvenienced. As the story grows in length, the author may easily forget the initial settings or foreshadowing. Moreover, they may come up with new ideas during the writing process, which can be challenging to edit or integrate with the previous work. All of these factors can contribute to losing readers' attention and become critical obstacles, especially for beginners.

Therefore, a saga idea was born.

## Project Description
Project Saga is an AI-powered story-writing assistant. Comparing to current Artificial Intelligence story writing AI tools (e.g. [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/)), Saga minimizes the potential creativity restriction by AI. The writer's personal writing style is one of the criteria for the book, so Saga won't help writers write stories directly. Instead, Saga aims to lower the threshold of writing and support writers to overcome writing obstacles themselves:

Scene one - Users only have vague ideas
Solution: Input keywords, core theme or sentences, let AI generate brainstorming ideas.

Scene two - Users are having trouble with characters setting
Solution: Based on the idea/outline provided by users, AI help to generate/attract characters and list them for users to modify. Characters attributes include name, beliefs, social standing (if applies), personality, etc. Personality could be based on the *Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) type that the users can start on. 

*Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI): Introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences, which has a total of 16 preferences type in 4 dimensions.

Scene three - Users are uncertain about the characters setting, having trouble naming
Solution: Users can edit the stored character list anything during the writing process. If the user changes the name of one character, this character's name that has appeared in the existing text will be replaced with the new name.
Beyond this function, users can use auto-name completion while they type the recorded character's name (or any object name in future features) to speed up their typing speed. Users will be benefited especially when the name string is long or in a multi-lingual environment.

Scene four - Users finished one chapter, but are unsure if their texts are off-topic (deviate from the outline)
Solution: AI-empowered proofread. AI will summarize paragraph the users have written. Users will then be able to compare with the summary of their current text and target content (the outline).


## What it does
Compared to letting AI write stories directly, Saga focuses more on the structural building. While users input their ideas in the window, AI helps the user to store and update character settings and help the user to build an outline for it. Users can edit the outline including the storylines, world lines, every single character's stories, etc.
### Brainstorming
- By keywords
- By core idea

### Character settings
- Basic information (name, nick name, age, etc.)
- Appearance
- Beliefs/Stances
- Social status
- Personality (Based on MBTI)
- Relationships with other characters

### Writing Process
- Outlining
- Auto name-completion
- Modify name after finishing the story (find & replace throughout the whole story)
- Text generation (AI-enpowered)
- Statistics (word count, reading time, counts of characters' apearance etc.)
- Quick search by clicking on the character's name

### After finishing the story
- Proofreading
  - Summarize the body text (AI-enpowered)
  - Compare the summary with the outline
- Publish

## How we built it
React, Node.js, MongoDB, Typescript, and GPT-3.5

## Challenges we ran into



## Accomplishments that we're proud of



## What we learned



## What's next for Saga
### More approaches of outlining [Reference: writers.com](https://writers.com/how-to-write-a-story-outline)
- Plot-based
- Scene-based
- Theme-based

### Character attributes
Beyond what we have already for the character attributes, we will allow users to create/edit/delete customized attributes for each character.

### Children friendly
We will add a children-friendly mode for Saga, which will allow users to create stories for children. The children-friendly mode will have a simplified interface and will only allow users to create stories for children.
Also, in the brainstorming session, we will ask AI to generate a sentence starter, let children using their creativity to finish the rest of the stories.

### Connect to graphic AI
We will connect Saga to graphic AI, which will allow users to create characters and scenes with graphic AI.
- Users can also use graphic AI to create the cover of their books.
- Use graphic AI to create the characters avators
- Manga
- Cartoon
- Game
- Connect to Metaverse

### User profiles
We will allow users to create profiles, which will allow them to save their stories and settings. Users can also share their stories with other users.

### Mobile app
We will create a mobile app for Saga, which will allow users to create and share stories on their phones.

### Audio to text
We will allow users to use audio to text to create stories, which will allow users to record their ideas anytime and anywhere.

### Relationship between characters

### Publish & Share
We will allow users to publish their stories on Saga or other potential platforms, which will allow other users to read their stories. Users can also share their stories on other social media platforms.
In addition, this can potentially collaborate with other platforms and sponsors to pay for the writers.

### Multi-language (multilingo) support
We will support multiple languages, which will allow users to create stories in different languages.
